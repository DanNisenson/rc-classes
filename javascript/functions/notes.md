1. Functions

-   Recap

    -   What is a function?
    -   When do we use them?
    -   Reusable block of code

-   Exercises

-   Function arguments (inputs)
-   Function return (output)
-   Function reference
-   Arrow functions
-   Scope (?)

2. Array methods

-   Compile previous concepts
    -   variables: we use them everywhere
    -   array methods: built-in Javascript tools
    -   loops: do one thing many times
    -   functions: write a reusable block of code
    -   arrow functions: we just do that now
    -   anonymous functions: we don't want to reuse it somewhere else
-   Map
-   Filter
